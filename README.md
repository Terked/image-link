# sound-link
Ability to add a journal button in your journals and items text areas that will show a journal.

The link needs to be added in the HTML part of the text editor. 
It looks like this:

```<a class="journal_link" data-journalid="JOURNAL ID" data-journaltype="IMAGE OR TEXT">Journal name</a>```

**IMPORTANT**

This does require **The Furnace** module installed with **Advanced Macros *ON***.

You also need to import **"toggle-journal"** macro from the *Furnace Macro Compendium* in to your game since this will be called from the sound link.
